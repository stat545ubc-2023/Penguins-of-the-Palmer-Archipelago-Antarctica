### **|| App description** 

This Shiny app uses data collected on three penguin species that inhabit the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica to create an educational, interactive viewer that enables a user to visualize and explore the penguins dataset. 

#### Version 1
The original app contains four tabs: the first two, Species and Islands, respectively contain images of the penguin species and the islands where they live. The third tab, Size Plots, contains three interactive scatter plots of penguin body mass plotted against another body size measurement that is input by the user. The fourth tab, Tables, contains the penguins dataset as an interactive data table that the user can filter by species and island(s). 

#### Version 2
The theme of the app was changed in version 2 to be more penguin-themed (black and white with blue accents). The updated version of the app contains a navigation panel with four tab panels: Penguin Species, Palmer Archipelago, Size Plots, and Data Tables. The Penguin Species tab panel contains a tab with image of all of the penguin species, and a tab for each of the three penguin species that each contain facts about the species and an embedded video. The Palmer Archipelago tab panel contains a button that when clicked will display a map of the islands where the penguins nest, and a button that will display a photo of the region. The Size Plot and Data Tables tab panels contain the same features as Version 1 of the app.

### **|| Dataset** 

This application uses the *penguins* dataset from the palmerpenguins package. The data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER (Long Term Ecological Research Network).
