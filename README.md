**|| App description** 

This Shiny app uses data collected on three penguin species that inhabit the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica to create an educational, interactive viewer that enables a user to visualize and explore the penguins dataset. It contains four tabs: the first two, Species and Islands, respectively contain images of the penguin species and the islands where they live. The third tab, Size Plots, contains three interactive scatter plots of penguin body mass plotted against another body size measurement that is input by the user. The fourth tab, Tables, contains the penguins dataset as an interactive data table that the user can filter by species and island(s).


**|| Dataset** 

This application uses the *penguins* dataset from the palmerpenguins package. The data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER (Long Term Ecological Research Network).
